Recent studies indicate that AI can:

- increase productivity by up to **40%**

  AI-driven campaigns deliver more precise targeting, reducing acquisition costs and increasing conversion rates by **20% to 30%**.

- **Greater engagement**  
  Personalization at scale boosts click-through rates (CTR) by up to **47%** compared to generic campaigns.

- **Operational efficiency**  
  Approximately **91% of marketing professionals** already use AI daily, resulting in:
  - 50% faster campaign launches
  - 45% reduction in operational costs

These numbers make one thing clear: AI is not a passing trend but a **strategic pillar for competitiveness in 2026**.
